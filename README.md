**a minimal execution layer for ai agents to automate real-world tasks**

brik makes it simple for ai agents to take real-world actions‚Äîbeyond just generating text. whether you‚Äôre building an agent that sends messages, books appointments, analyzes data, or manages workflows, brik provides modular tools to help you bridge the gap between "thinking" and "doing."

---

### **what is brik?**

brik is an execution framework for ai agents. think of it as a library of modular tools that agents can use to take actions in the real world.  
some examples:
- sending a whatsapp message
- booking flights or reservations
- automating email workflows
- running web searches
- integrating with productivity tools like slack or discord

it‚Äôs lightweight, developer-friendly, and built with modularity in mind.

### **features**

- **minimal and modular**: simple, no-frills tools that are easy to plug into your agent workflows.
- **real-world actions**: enable agents to go beyond generating text and actually execute tasks.
- **developer-first**: designed to be intuitive, with clear apis and minimal setup.
- **hugging face integrations**: works seamlessly with your favorite llms from openai, hugging face, or local models.

### **quickstart**

#### **install brik**

```bash
pip install brik
```

#### **example: sending a whatsapp message**

```python
from brik.tools import SendWhatsAppMessageTool

# initialize the whatsapp tool with your twilio credentials
whatsapp_tool = SendWhatsAppMessageTool(
    account_sid="your_twilio_account_sid",
    auth_token="your_twilio_auth_token",
    from_number="+your_twilio_whatsapp_number"
)

# send a message
response = whatsapp_tool.forward(to="+1234567890", message="hello from brik!")
print(response)
```

#### **example: using brik with an agent**

```python
from brik.tools import SendSlackMessageTool, SendEmailTool
from smolagents import CodeAgent
from smolagents.models import HfApiModel

# initialize tools
slack_tool = SendSlackMessageTool()
email_tool = SendEmailTool(
    smtp_server="smtp.gmail.com",
    smtp_port=587,
    sender_email="your_email@gmail.com",
    sender_password="your_app_password"
)

# initialize the agent
model = HfApiModel()
agent = CodeAgent(tools=[slack_tool, email_tool], model=model)

# run the agent
agent.run("send a slack message saying 'launch successful' and email a summary to the team.")
```
